# helloWorld

In March 2018 I decided to make a complete life change and embark on 
a career as a software developer. 

To prepare for this change I took on a tutor in maths and computer science and 
over the last year and a half have been learning Python and building small systems. 

At the moment I have started learning java and C++, and have currently secured
a placement on an Artificial Intelligence masters st Starthclyde Uniersity 
beginning in September 2019. 

I love the area of machine learning, artificial intelligence and have recently
discovered the joys of rasberryPi. I've undertaken a project to build a small 
autonomous vehicle that will hunt rats in a large warehouse. 

As a complete beginner who continues to learn and build on experience every day
I welcome advice, comments and critisicm on my code. I aim to take all advice on board
by making sure I truly understand where I could have taken a different approach.
