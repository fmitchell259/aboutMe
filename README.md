# helloWorld

In March 2018 I decided to make a complete life change and embark on 
a career as a software developer. 

To prepare for this I embarked ona a tutorage in maths and computer science, re-learning 
linear algebra, statistics and probability. I also fell in love with coding and have become
a competant Python programmer able to build small systems. 

I have started learning java and C++, and have currently secured
a placement on an Artificial Intelligence masters st Strathclyde University 
beginning in September 2019. 

I love the area of machine-learning, artificial-intelligence and have recently
discovered the joys of a rasberryPi. I've undertaken a project to build a small 
autonomous vehicle that will hunt rats in a large warehouse with the rasberryPi and
added raspiRobotBoard at the heart of the machine. 

As a beginner programmer I welcome advice, comments and critisicm on my code. 
I aim to take all views on board, with every attempt to truly understand where I might 
have taken a different approach. I plan to post my small projects as I continue 
to learn, and view this platform as a perfect place to grow within a collaborative 
environment.
